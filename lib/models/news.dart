        "House GOP seeks to restart momentum on border security package but familiar sticking points emerge",
    "content":
        "Even though border security has broad support among the GOP base, House Republicans are struggling to navigate the challenges of governing in a razor-thin majority even on bills – like this one – that are dead on arrival in the Senate, and have resisted committing to when or how the package would pass. The package will move through the House Judiciary panel, where Roy and a number of other hardline conservatives sit, instead of the House Homeland Security Committee, where Gonzales and Gimenez are members. House Homeland Security Republicans are expected to move a separate border security package through their committee as well.",

    "content":
        "Disney’s live-action adaptation of \"Lilo & Stitch\" has sparked a conversation about colorism in Hollywood, as fans express disappointment over the reported casting decision for the character Nani. Sydney Agudong, a mixed-race actor with light skin, is set to play Nani, who was originally portrayed with dark skin and distinctive indigenous features in the 2002 animated version. Critics argue that the casting reinforces societal preferences for lighter skin, potentially contributing to erasure and perpetuating deep-rooted beauty standards. Hawaii's diverse population, which includes individuals with lighter skin, challenges the notion that skin color determines Hawaiian identity. Disney and Agudong's representatives have not provided any comments on the matter."

        "\"Abbott Elementary\" Season 2 finale featured Janine and Gregory confronting their feelings for each other during an overnight field trip to the Franklin Institute.

        "Real Madrid beats Chelsea comfortably 2-0 but regrets not killing off Champions League tie",
    "content":
        "As far as Champions League quarterfinals go, Real Madrid had a relatively comfortable night against Chelsea on Wednesday. The Spanish giant breezed past its English visitor 2-0 to take a strong advantage going into next week’s second leg but, despite the relative ease in which it won, Madrid keeper Thibaut Courtois still had regrets. Los Blancos dominated large periods of the game throughout and limited Chelsea to very few chances. The Premier League side then had to play the last 30 minutes with 10 men after defender Ben Chilwell was shown a straight red card for denying a goal-scoring opportunity. “Every time you play a big knockout match, you’re left with the sensation that you could have, should have, killed the tie off,” former Chelsea keeper Courtois told reporters after the game. “This is a good result, but we’re bugged by the fact that we didn’t score a third or even a fourth goal. I hope we don’t regret not having added another when we play again next week.” Karim Benzema had given Madrid the lead from close range in the first half – his 90th career goal in the competition – before substitute Marco Asensio doubled the advantage in the 74th minute with a stunning strike. In truth, Madrid could have scored even more against a Chelsea team struggling for form. The London club sacked manager Graham Potter last week and put former player and boss Frank Lampard in temporary charge. Despite the uncertainty swirling around the club, Chelsea co-owner and chairman Todd Boehly told Sky Sports that he predicted a 3-0 for his side; it’s safe to say the American was served a dose of reality. In truth, a test against the reigning European champion was always going to be a tough ask for a club in crisis and it proved as much.

    "title": "You can make your Mercedes EV go faster for 60 a month",
    "content":
        "Mercedes-Benz electric vehicle owners in North America who want a little more power and speed can now buy 60 horsepower for just 60 a month or, on other models, 80 horsepower for \$90 a month.\n\nThey won’t have to visit a Mercedes dealer to get the upgrade either, or even leave their own driveway. The added power, which will provide a nearly one second decrease in zero-to-60 acceleration, will be available through an over-the-air software patch.\n\nBuyers can bypass the monthly subscription completely however, and opt for an annual subscription payment or simply pay a one-time flat fee. For instance, a buyer could take an all-wheel-drive Mercedes-Benz EQE 350 sedan from its standard 288 horsepower to 348 permanently for 1,950.\n\nThese upgrades are a booming business for car companies. Mercedes is not alone in offering upgrades, or even new features, through over-the-air updates, similar the way software and capabilities can be added on phones. Tesla has offered additional driving assistance features and even added range through software downloads. In some markets, BMW has offered heated seats as a downloadable add-on.\n\nVarious automakers have touted the potential for recurring revenue from subscription features like this. General Motors chief executive Mary Barra has said she hopes for GM to bring in as much as 20 billion to 25 billion annually from subscriptions by 2030. Stellantis has also said it plans to generate billions of dollars from subscriptions. Mercedes executives have said in the past they expect the German luxury automaker to make more than 1 billion annually from software subscriptions.\n\nThe power-unleashing software upgrades are available through the Mercedes Me online store in the vehicles. The power upgrade subscription is offered only in the US currently – laws in other countries forbid changes to the vehicle’s powertrain after it’s been purchased. The upgrades do not change how far the vehicles can drive on a charge, according to Mercedes, assuming normal driving."

        "Tickets for Arsenal’s final game of the season being sold for extortionate prices by third-party sellers",
    "content":
        "Tickets for Arsenal’s final game of the season against Wolverhampton Wanderers are being touted on resale website StubHub for extortionate prices. The Gunners are on course to win a first Premier League title in 19 years and some people, it seems, are taking advantage of fans’ desperation to see the team hoist the trophy in person at the Emirates Stadium on May 28. At the time of writing, the cheapest tickets on StubHub are going for \$1,175, while others are being touted for an eye-watering \$65,000. The most expensive ticket – situated in the section where the Wolves fans would sit – is listed at \$330,000. Seller details are not available on the website. Akhil Vyas, a board member of the Arsenal Supporters Trust, says it remains “frustrating and disappointing” to see third-party websites reselling Arsenal tickets. “But there is more to this than meets the eye,” he tells CNN. “If any fans are selling their own ticket, despite having sympathy during this cost of living crisis, it’s illegal and they shouldn’t be doing it.” In the Premier League, tickets are meant to be resold through the club to other members or fans on waiting lists. “If you are looking to buy tickets for matches in the Premier League you should buy them directly from Premier League Clubs,” the Premier League says on its website. “A ‘ticket tout’ (also known as a ‘scalper’) sells match tickets without authorisation, often at vastly inflated prices. “Touts no longer just sell tickets outside the stadium, they also sell them (and aid unauthorised sales by others) on websites and online marketplaces.”"
